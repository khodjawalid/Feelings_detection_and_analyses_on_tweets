# Feelings detection and analyses on tweets 

### Overview 
- First part of the project implements data preprocessing procedures like tokenisation and lemmentation then apply NLP algorithm TF-IDF to train a machine learning model (Logistic regression) on detecting tweets feelin, Finally it calculate model performance with metrrics like ROC, acuracy, precision, recall and f1 score.
- The second part implement a Data analyses using ddifferent type of vissualisation.

### General Project workflow
- Data preprocessing (Delete stop word, Tokenisation, Numerisation ...etc).
- Model trainning.
- Model testinng andd performance testing
